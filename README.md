## Volareo Open Source Smart Speaker

Welcome to the Volareo repo. This place will be updated when development of the Volareo Smart Speaker progresses. This repo will be your one-stop-shop for all things related to the Volareo Voice API, its on-board AI, inputs, ouputs, services, soft- and firmware. 

## Open Source as a starting point

We've built the Volareo Smart Speaker with open source as a starting point. This means that as much of the elements that make up the Volareo Smart Speaker are open sourced as possible. We envision a future where programmers build bridges between IoT, blockchain, cryptocurrencies and voice-commerce and -commands.

## Great Volareo partnerships

We are partnering with amazing partners who will bring extra functionality and use-cases to the Volareo Smart Speaker. Please find the list below. This list will extend over time, so please keep an eye out on our repository for new partnership announcements, which could bring exciting new features to the Volareo Smart Speaker!

### [Musicoin](https://musicoin.org/)

With Volareo you can create more meaningful relations with your listeners through deep integration of the Musicoin system into the Volareo smart speaker. Receive tips and see where your listeners are coming from, directly through the Musicoin dashboard. You can stream the complete database of Musicoin, for free, directly to your Volareo Smart Speaker.

### [Choon](https://choon.co/)

By partnering with Choon, we have seriously extended the amount of artists and music available for free directly on your Volareo Smart Speaker.

Emanate is a "Self-governing Audio Exchange Protocol". Emanate is building an Audio Exchange Protocol designed to evolve the music industry into the blockchain era, allowing artists to be paid in real-time, to collaborate globally without the need of trust. This could bring much needed efficiency and transparency to the music industry. Emanate plans to create a self governing decentralised organisation that will align the incentives of all the music industry participants. 

## What can you do with the Volareo Smart Speaker?

We are heavily relying on developers like you to extend the core functionality of the Volareo Smart Speaker. Soon we'll make the source code available for free for you to poke around with, and eventually create amazing DVApps (Decentralized Voice Apps). With these apps we are aiming to extend functionality and bring information, entertainment and voice-commerce to the people.

## When will this repo be updated?

Soon! Expect more updates in Q4 2018.
